Changelog in the changelog.txt file.


About:

Add search option to search on Userscripts.org, OpenUserJS.org, MonkeyGuts.com, Google.com(Beta;working but not giving best results) and Google Custom Search(Search all userscript websites with one click). And i added especially at the 5.0 update the ability to search Userscripts-mirror.org(as userscripts.org has shut down for good) through a Google Custom Search Engine made by me as the website does not have its self a posibility to search it. 
In case you usually confuse userscripts.org with userscripts-mirror.org please tell me to remove userscripts.org from the script or move userscripts-mirror.org a little bit lower in the menu.
It has MIT license. Based on the code made by LouCypher Link: https://greasyfork.org/en/users/4-loucypher. Original code: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/259-greasy-fork-search-other-sites . Remodified by Me(HACKSCOMICON). Adding more in the future.

Attention: I have added "@updateURL" for various userscripts add-ons and "@downloadURL" for other userscripts add-ons. Tell me if your userscript program is affected by the presence of both of them.
